This repository contains two Python scripts that take
a list of tasks exported from Remember The Milk and convert
it to Gina Trapani's todo.txt format (see http://todotxt.com/).

The first script, atom_to_todotxt.py, accepts task
data as an Atom feed, which can be downloaded from
https://www.rememberthemilk.com/atom/YOUR_RTM_USER_NAME/
The script looks for an input file named 'Atom_Feed.xml' in the
current directory and saves its output as 'todo.txt.RTM'.

The second script, ics_to_todotxt.py, does the same, but
expects input data in iCalendar format.  The input is read
from a file named 'iCalendar_Service.ics' and the output is
saved, again, as 'todo.txt.RTM'.

To download task data in iCalendar format, use this URL:
https://www.rememberthemilk.com/icalendar/YOUR_RTM_USER_NAME/

The latter script is preferable.  If it doesn't work for you,
please let me know and I'll fix it (my contact email should be
somewhere around here).  And, of course, pull requests are
always welcome.

RTM lists are coverted to todo.txt projects (+Project), and
RTM tags and locations are converted to contexts (@Context).
Unfortunately, although iCalendar format contains much more
information about tasks, it's missing RTM list names, so if
those are important, the two options left are:
1) use atom_to_todotxt.py
2) reconstruct the list names in ics_to_todotxt.py output
   manually.

See also docstrings within each script for more details.
